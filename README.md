# LakeChad

Lake Chad is a shallow freshwater lake situated in the Sahel region of Africa, which is shared by four countries: Chad, Niger, Nigeria, and Cameroon. It was once one of the largest lakes in Africa, covering an area of about 26,000 square kilometers. However, over the years, Lake Chad has shrunk dramatically, and its size has been reduced by over 90% since the 1960s.
